## Hi visitor, I'm Ishir ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Masters student ([MRSD](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/masters-programs/masters-robotics-and-autonomous-systems/)) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, and I'm an aspiring robotist. With prior background in perception and controls, I'm keen on developing (and learning) robots that can accomplish tasks which are challenging for humans.

[Wildfire Drone](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2024teamb/) :
As part of a 5 member team, we developed an autonomous aerial system capable of GPS denied navigation (simulating under canopy motion), obstacle avoidance (avoiding tree trunks), and mapping fire hotspots in an area (simulating wildfire hotspots). Live demos linked [Spring Sem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAE71FNCuks) and [Fall Sem]().

[Franka-Stein](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17YVXuGEJ2rgmDS1DY1Mh6kl8ccbDTyVC/view?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook) :
As part of 3 member course project, we deveolped software stack for erasing whiteboard marking autonomously with a robot arm. Hardware used was a FRANKA arm and Intel RealSense D435i. Demo video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNvjeiw5U4U&list=LL&index=2).


<!-- #### Context Aware Grasping
This was a exploratory course project in an attempt to get a contextually aware grasp point given an object in a scene using VQA to describe the scene, LLM to make a decision, and VLM to locate the appropraite object from options/most appropriate grasp point.  -->


[UAV guided UGV Navigation](https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/inter_iit_uav_guided_ugv) :
Simulation challenge part of the 10th Inter IIT Tech Meet, where the problem statement was to map out a trajectory on a mountainous road and guide a UGV on the snowy road using an overhead UAV.

[Vision based Obstacle Avoidance for UAV](https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/inter_iit_dgre_voad) :
Simulation Challenge part of the Inter-IIT Tech Meet which happens annually. The problem statement was to autonomously explore a maze and land on a aruco platform upon completion.
