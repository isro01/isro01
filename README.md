## Hi visitor, I'm Ishir ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Masters student ([MRSD](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/masters-programs/masters-robotics-and-autonomous-systems/)) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, and I'm an aspiring robotist. With prior background in perception and controls, I'm keen on developing (and learning) robots that can accomplish tasks which are challenging for humans.

<!-- #### Context Aware Grasping
This was a exploratory course project in an attempt to get a contextually aware grasp point given an object in a scene using VQA to describe the scene, LLM to make a decision, and VLM to locate the appropraite object from options/most appropriate grasp point.  -->
